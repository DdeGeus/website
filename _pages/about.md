Welcome to my website! I'm a computer vision researcher in the <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/signal-processing-systems/mobile-perception-systems-lab">Mobile Perception Systems lab</a> at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Here, you can find my latest research. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, or if you have cool ideas that you want to discuss.
